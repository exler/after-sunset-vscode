## Development

[VSCode Theme Color Reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color)

* Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded.
* Open `File > Preferences > Color Themes` and pick your color theme.
* Open a file that has a language associated. The languages' configured grammar will tokenize the text and assign 'scopes' to the tokens. To examine these scopes, invoke the `Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).
